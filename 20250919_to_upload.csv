Originally released on Blue Collar Records in 1986, this underground classic finally returns to wax-remastered by Rob Colwell (Swirling Eddies, Sixpence), and pressed on heavyweight Blue Sky Vinyl, strictly limited to 250 copies worldwide.This reissue isn't just a nostalgia piece-it's a long-overdue celebration of a visionary album that continues to resonate nearly four decades after it's release. With stunning new sound and a 12x12 full-color insert featuring lyrics and rare photos, plus an expansive new write-up by John Joseph Thompson (True Tunes), this edition honors the depth and legacy of a truly singular band.Led by the late Gene Eugene-producer, engineer, and poetic force behind Adam Again, The Lost Dogs, and The Swirling Eddies-In a New World of Time defies the expectations of '80s Christian music. With unmistakable echoes of R.E.M., Talking Heads, and The Cure, the album fuses New Wave, funk, and art rock into something raw, soulful, and deeply introspective.Eugene's lyrics confront real-world struggles and spiritual searching with emotional honesty. On ""You Can Fall in Love,"" he delivers one of the band's most vulnerable faith statements:""He was God and nothing less / He came to fill your emptiness.""Greg Lawless's freak-funk guitar work, Paul Valadez's (RIP) grounding bass lines, and Riki Michele's dynamic vocals all elevate this album to a level few dared to reach in that era. The record's original Howard Finster cover art (famed for his work with R.E.M. and Talking Heads) only adds to it's underground legacy.Ranked #278 on the ""300 Greatest CCM Albums of the '80s"", In a New World of Time still sounds like the future-melodic, messy, searching, and soaked in soul.This is more than a reissue. This is a restoration of a vital chapter in alternative rock history.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,35.2446,42.2446,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/40/4438140-3408777.jpg,FALSE,lb,29.2446,TRUE,TRUE,draft

See the full list of the week for more details, and email info@latchkeyrecords.com with any questions!</p><p>It's impossible to talk about Wicca Phase Springs Eternal without talking about transformation. For over a decade the singer, songwriter and producer Adam Andrzejewski has used the moniker as a wide creative umbrella, under which he's made a vast body of work that's as consistently compelling as it is constantly changing. This deft ability to blend sounds and styles has become his calling card, but no matter the genre signifiers-from rap beats, to new wave synths, to goth atmospherics-the beating heart of WPSE is Andrzejewski's singular voice and esoteric-yet-emotional lyricism. Those key elements have centered the project through musical explorations, and now on his latest full-length, Mossy Oak Shadow, Andrzejewski really puts them to the test. Shedding thumping 808s and intricate production in favor of a no-frills band and sparse live recording, the album is a stirring collection of hazy folk rock songs that prove Wicca Phase Springs Eternal can truly be anything.  ""I always kind of thought that as long as I have the Wicca Phase Springs Eternal name that I can do whatever I want,"" Andrzejewski explains. ""The name provides a framework for the lyrics and aesthetics of the project-my songwriting with a mystical overlay to it-and as long as I can make something work within that, then the genre doesn't totally matter."" That daring creative mentality is what steered Andrzejewski when he first started the WPSE project, through his work as a co-founder of the influential GothBoiClique collective, or as member of Thraxxhouse and Misery Club, and even with his punk side project, Pay For Pain. Still, few could have guessed that the new proper Wicca Phase Springs Eternal release would be a set of country-leaning folk songs performed without a wink in sight. As with all things Wicca Phase, Mossy Oak Shadow finds Andrzejewski fully committed. Mossy Oak Shadow might seem like a drastic pivot for the Wicca Phase Springs Eternal fans who got on board through his beat-driven modern classic albums, like 2016's Secret Boy or 2018's Suffer On-but it shouldn't come as a total surprise. WPSE releases have always dabbled in stripped-down acoustic songs, and even further back there's Andrzejewski's earlier work as a member of emo/indie stalwarts Tigers Jaw. When he left that band to focus on Wicca Phase in 2013, he was met with skepticism from listeners who were hesitant to embrace his new persona and experimental trap sound. Ironically now Andrzejewski has so thoroughly established Wicca Phase Springs Eternal that he's once again challenging his fans with a stark sonic shift-but this time by returning to the guitar-oriented songwriting he'd set aside. ""Dylan, Will Oldman, Richard Thompson-what I like most about those songwriters is that I'm able to trust them,"" Andrzejewski explains. ""If they do something that's totally strange I trust that they know what they're doing because it's coming from the same person that wrote all these other songs that I love. So even if it might take some time for me to get where they are, I want to try.""</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,25.2346,32.2346,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/03/4444303-3419439.jpg,FALSE,lb,19.2346,TRUE,TRUE,draft

And if you can't precisely define the band, that's the point. Frontman Ian Richard Devaney has become prodigious in expanding what synthesizer-driven music can evoke, such that his output is as much an extrasensory journey as it is an all-too-human destination. With that experience in mind, he wrote the band's fourth album - the spectral, spacious Dance Called Memory - in the most humble of ways: chipping away at melancholia by sitting around and strumming his guitar. Nation of Language's first two albums, Introduction, Presence (2020), and A Way Forward (2021), came as pandemic godsends: gorgeous, relatable soundtracks to our collective doldrums. But it was their last LP, Strange Disciple (2023), that catapulted the group from cultural standouts to critical darlings, with the album being named Rough Trade's Album of the Year. With that release, Pitchfork wrote that the band ""are learning what it means to get bigger and better."" This is Devaney's calling: soulfully translating individual despair into a comforting, collective mourning. The single ""Now That You're Gone,"" which radiates and reverberates with a devastating wistfulness, was inspired by witnessing his godfather's tragic death from ALS, and his parents' role as caretakers for this ailing friend. At it's heart, the song is a reflection of how friends can be there for each other, and also highlights a theme throughout the record: the pain and lost promise of friendships that fall apart. On Dance Called Memory, the band once again collaborated with friend and Strange Disciple producer Nick Millhiser (LCD Soundsystem, Holy Ghost!). ""What's so great about Nick is his ability to make us feel like we don't need to do what might be expected of us,"" says synth player Aidan Noell, who, along with bassist Alex MacKay, rounds out the Nation of Language lineup. They imbued Dance Called Memory with a shifted palette - sampling chopped-up drum breaks on ""I'm Not Ready for the Change"" for a touch of Loveless-era My Bloody Valentine, or smashing all of the percussion of ""In Another Life"" through a synthesizer to cast a shade of early-2000s electronic music. Ultimately, the hope was to weave raw vulnerability and humanity into a synth-heavy album. ""There is a dichotomy between the Kraftwerk school of thought and the Brian Eno school of thought, each of which I've been drawn to at different points. I've read about how Kraftwerk wanted to remove all of the humanity from their music, but Eno often spoke about wanting to make synthesized music that felt distinctly human,"" Devaney says. ""As much as Kraftwerk is a sonically foundational influence, with this record I leaned much more towards the Eno school of thought. In this era quickly being defined by the rise of AI supplanting human creators I'm focusing more on the human condition, and I need the underlying music to support that... Instead of hopelessness, I want to leave the listener with a feeling of us really seeing one another, that our individual struggles can actually unite us in empathy.""</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,25.2346,32.2346,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/61/4435661-3409373.jpg,FALSE,lb,19.2346,TRUE,TRUE,draft

The album 'Some Kind of Feeling' showcases Orianthi's electrifying guitarisma, in the context of songs that mark an inspiring return to her first stylistic love - a more organic, 60's-70's rock blues vibe.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,28.314600000000002,35.3146,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/22/4428522-3395978.jpg,FALSE,lb,22.314600000000002,TRUE,TRUE,draft

Includes the singles 'Underpass', 'No-One Driving', 'Burning Car' and 'Miles Away', the latter hinting at a new direction after the minimalism of his 1980 album, Metamatic. Some of Foxx's strongest work is on the B-sides with the likes of 'Film One' and 'Mr. No' being particular Aphex Twin favorites, while 'This City' could easily have been a single in it's own right. An alternative take on '20th Century' became the theme for the Janet Street-Porter TV magazine show, 20th Century Box which was first broadcast by London Weekend Television in 1980, but this B-side remains the definitive, full fledged version. To complete the album are two tracks - 'Cinemascope' and 'To Be With You' - which were later constructed by Foxx out of original cassette recordings, notes and lyrics from the Metamatic sessions and have never been released on vinyl before.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,33.7046,40.7046,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/01/4450701-3436704.jpg,FALSE,lb,27.7046,TRUE,TRUE,draft

A step up in every regard, Changelings is astonishing in it's accomplished precision and how much it manages to achieve within the scope of individual tracks and as a cohesive whole. The album features an overload of angular guitar warfare, traditional Euro-thrash aggression with a modern resonance, rhythmic percussive seizures, and intricate basslines that make their intention deeply felt, not just following the guitar but dialoguing with it in a way that offers a second melodic brain to the album.

Nowhere is it more apparent than on 10-minute album closer ""Biological Masterpiece"", where Species displays all it's weapons; hyperspeed assaults, dystopian lulls and instrumental mastery, in a climatic saga beyond space and time.

Produced by GRAMMY-winning Adrian Quesada of Black Pumas, the album was inspired by a world's worth of influences and the pursuit of a vintage, real sound. The duo of brothers Henry and Reuben Smith have released several well-received singles, including the lead 7-inch single ""All The While."" The band has also announced a US tour this fall with Skinshape.  With a sound untethered to time or place, Sons of Sevilla-the brother duo of Henry and Reuben Smith-craft songs that drift between continents and eras. Raised in the shadow of a British pub on the outskirts of Leeds, educated by the jukebox and summer trips to sunlit Sevilla, their music blends transatlantic storytelling with borderless textures.  No longer just an English indie rock band-if they ever were-Sons of Sevilla's Street Light Moon inhabits a space all their own: untethered, exploratory, and evocative.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,23.6946,30.6946,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/92/4451392-3436897.jpg,FALSE,lb,17.6946,TRUE,TRUE,draft

Arnold, and Farlowe himself.Originally released in 1966, 14 Things To Think About is widely regarded as one of the finest Beat, Mod, R&B, and Soul albums of the era. It showcases Farlowe's distinctive husky voice and unique phrasing - a style that stood out in the competitive British R&B scene. The LP was driven by his hit singles, including his chart-topping rendition of ""Out of Time"", and features standout tracks like ""Think"" and a soulful reimagining of Bob Dylan's ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue.""From bluesy grit to soul-drenched ballads, this reissue captures the raw emotion and musical craftsmanship that made Farlowe a pillar of the mod and soul scenes. It also serves as a time capsule from an era when British music was transforming pop culture both at home and abroad.""Listening to these tracks, you will appreciate the artistry of Chris Farlowe, "" says music historian Ray Tolliday, underscoring the singer's unmatched contribution to the genre.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,27.9296,34.9296,TRUE,TRUE,,FALSE,lb,21.9296,TRUE,TRUE,draft

Sarah McLachlan first emerged as a global phenomenon over three decades ago, introducing an unprecedented new voice into the pop canon: soulful, spellbinding, and supremely capable of transforming pain into transcendence. On her first album of new material in 11 years, Better Broken finds the Canadian singer/songwriter widening her creative circle and furthering her legacy with songs that speak an uncompromising but radically illuminating truth about the state of the human condition.

Long past the belief that great art needs great pain, he challenges the trope that creativity must be born from trauma. Instead, Atmosphere's fifth release of the 2020s reflects a more grounded kind of struggle-one rooted in reflection, routine, and the work of becoming.The album's ambitious structure mirrors it's introspection: 26 songs, each titled with a different letter of the alphabet and sequenced from A to Z. Even guest appearances follow suit-Evidence lands on ""Effortless,"" Kurious on ""Kilowatts,"" and Musab, Muja Messiah, and Mike the Martyr appear on ""Mash."" Many tracks are strikingly short-one or two verses at most-delivering sharp ideas with precision and restraint.More than a look back, Jestures is a meditation on movement and meaning. Slug weaves memory and present-day reality over Ant's richly textured beats, blending electro-glitch, warm twang, and cinematic drones. It's a mosaic of life's overlooked moments-how a partner's habits, a child's quirks, or a passing sound can reveal something new. What emerges is a story of progress, building toward a future defined by resilience and creative clarity.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,32.9346,39.9346,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/94/4445194-3420572.jpg,FALSE,lb,26.9346,TRUE,TRUE,draft

You may be familiar with the hypnotic, entrancing tones of Ibarra's vocals through his work with the Latin Grammy award-winning, four-piece, Bala Desejo and the band Dônica. He has also toured with the musical titan, Milton Nascimento, performing guitar and vocals, which is quite the honour and a testament to Ibarra's craft. As a solo artist, he has performed headline solo shows in Japan, Portugal and the US, as well as recently completing a support tour with the great, Seu Jorge. 'AFIM' is comprised of eight tracks, featuring Zé's own compositions as well as cover versions of tracks by contemporaries and friends, Sophia Chablau, Tom Veloso, and Dora Morelenbaum. It combines elements of MPB, jazz, pop and progressive rock in a bold, authoritative style. The album represents the intersection between different facets of the artist, from the stripped-down, intimate, guitar singer-songwriter, to dense arrangements with sweeping strings sections. Writing this album allowed Ibarra ""to explore sides of myself that had not yet been organized in an album: a certain darkness, a more cinematic musicality, a desire for new soundscapes. The album features the single, 'Transe', a song with an instantly comforting tone reminiscent of classic Brazilian songs of the past (think Caetano Veloso). It is built on a rhythmic guitar that supports dynamic sound layers, opening space for Ibarra's intense interpretation. Cinematic atmospheres that lend an air of mystery come courtesy of string arrangements by Jaques Morelenbaum.His unique cover version of Sophia Chablau's 'Segredo' is equally compelling, taking Sophia's punky-indie original in a different direction and making it feel like his own. 'Essa Confusão', a song celebrating the intensity of love and co-written by Dora Morelenbaum, is steered into epic, 70's AOR, singer-songwriter territory with wind arrangements by Ibarra, Jorge Continentino and strings by Jaques Morelenbaum. The album is the result of the collaboration of experienced musicians and long-time partners of Ibarra. Fellow Bala Desejo and Dônica member Lucas Nunes co-produced the album. The core band featured on the record consists of Lucas Nunes on organs, Alberto Continentino on bass, Daniel Conceição and Thomas Harres on drums and percussion, Rodrigo Pacato on additional percussion, Chico Lira on Fender Rhodes and Guilherme Lírio on guitar. The overall feel of the record is archetypically quintessential without slipping into retro mode. It is a stunning album from one of the finest musicians of his generation. A true star of Brazil's blooming contemporary scene.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,32.16459999999999,39.16459999999999,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/99/4442699-3416273.jpg,FALSE,lb,26.164599999999997,TRUE,TRUE,draft

The film, directed by Ondrej Trojan, won two Czech Lions (Czech and Television Academy Award) and a number of nominations, including the most prestigious one - an Oscar nomination for the best foreign language film. Although almost 22 years have passed since it's release and the composer had been considering the idea of ?releasing the score on vinyl for some time, the final impetus for the album's release was this year's departure of the legendary film conductor Mario Klemens, who had participated in number of film soundtracks and who also conducted the orchestra during the recording of the music for the film zelary; the album is dedicated to his memory. Petr Ostrouchov received his first (out of eight) nomination for the Czech Lion award and the award for best music from the festival in Karachi, Pakistan.""zelary was only the second feature film with my music and a very important one for me.As a beginner and amateur, I composed and arranged music for the orchestra and had the opportunity to work with conductor Mario Klemens. Moreover, the film resonated very well, it received an Oscar nomination, I received my first nomination for the Czech Lion Award and Viera Langerova brought me the award for best music from the festival in Karachi, Pakistan, where I ""beat"" Alexandre Desplat and John Williams in my category, both these facts seemed absurd to me. The soundtrack was released on CD 22 years ago, the music was interwoven with dialogues from the film, as was usual back then, and the CD has long since been unavailable. The idea of ?releasing the music from zelary in newly mixed versions and in a different way has matured for many years, the film has certainly not been forgotten, on the contrary, it still has it's audiences and the ""music from zelary"" has opened many doors for me. I compiled the recordings into a more or less fluid flow of music, without dialogues, with only a few folk songs of great female ensemble from the Beskid Mountains called Grunik,"" says Petr Ostrouchov about the album's release.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,46.0323,53.0323,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/83/4442483-3418401.jpg,FALSE,lb,40.0323,TRUE,TRUE,draft

Originally released in 1988 on Broken Records, this iconic album returns remastered by Rob Colwell (Swirling Eddies, Sixpence) and pressed in a strictly limited run of just 250 copies, Juniper Green Vinyl.Ten Songs marks a turning point for Adam Again. Building on the raw energy of their debut, Gene Eugene and company deliver a collection that is deeper, groovier, and more emotionally resonant. The band draws from the rhythmic tension of Talking Heads, the introspection of R.E.M., and the art-rock edge of Daniel Amos and The Choir-yet emerges with a sound entirely their own.From the slow-burning lament of ""Eyes Wide Open"" to their unforgettable cover of Bill Withers' ""Ain't No Sunshine,"" this album explores themes of faith, doubt, heartbreak, and longing with poetic clarity. Eugene's voice aches with conviction, while the band surrounds him with funk-laced rhythms, post-punk textures, and bursts of melodic brilliance.This reissue includes a stunning 12x12 full-color insert with lyrics and rare band photos, along with an expansive new write-up by John Joseph Thompson (True Tunes), offering rich context for one of Christian alternative music's most important works.Ten Songs by Adam Again is the only album by the band to appear on CCM Magazine's 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music (ranked #55), and it lands at #138 on the CCM's 500 Best Albums of All Time list. Decades later, it's impact still reverberates.This is more than a reissue-it's a restoration of a masterpiece. Experience it like never before, in rich analog sound, and rediscover why Ten Songs continues to inspire and challenge listeners across generations.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,35.2446,42.2446,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/42/4438142-3408772.jpg,FALSE,lb,29.2446,TRUE,TRUE,draft

This album is one of Herbie Hancock's first departures from the traditional idioms of jazz, as well as the beginning of an original and creative style which eventually appealed to a wider audience. In addition, Mwandishi was Hancock's attempt at continuing the musical principles and styles he explored in his previous experiences with Miles Davis. Mwandishi was recorded at Wally Heider Studios Studio C, in San Francisco, California in January 1971, by Hancock's Mwandishi Sextet. The recording incorporated progressive notions of funk, jazz, and rock. Herbie Hancock is one of the most prolific jazz pianists of the 20th century. A child prodigy, he played with greats such as Donald Byrd and Miles Davis.

Butler, an album title from a collection of metaphysical poetry, and an expansion in consciousness brought on by personal crisis, guitarist and songwriter Shana Cleveland learns to embrace a changing world with unconditional love on News of the Universe, the new full-length from California rock band La Luz.News of the Universe is a record born of calamity, a work of dark, beautiful psychedelia reflecting Cleveland's experience of having her world blown apart by a breast cancer diagnosis just two years after the birth of her son. It's also a portrait of a band in flux, marking the first appearance for drummer Audrey Johnson and the final ones from longtime members bassist Lena Simon and keyboardist Alice Sandahl, whose contributions add a bittersweet edge to a record that is both elegy for an old world and cosmic road map to a strange new one.But is there any band in the world more suited to capturing the chaos of change in all it's messy beauty than La Luz? Formed by Cleveland in 2012, La Luz is beloved for their ability to balance bedlam and bliss, each new record another fine-tuning of the band's mix of swaggering riffs with angelic vocals borrowed from doo-wop and folk; a band so reliably great that it makes the huge step forward in confidence and sheer musicality that is News of the Universe all the more formidable. Cleveland, also a writer and painter, has developed into a truly original songwriter with her own canon of haunted psychedelia. Yet if Cleveland has spent years writing songs about ghosts, what lurks in the shadows of News of the Universe is nothing less than death itself. ""There are moments on this album that sound to me like the last frantic confession before an asteroid destroys the earth,"" says Cleveland. The powerful sense of openness that permeates News of the Universe is at least partially due to the fact that it is a record made entirely by women-from the performing, writing, and producing all the way through to the recording, engineering, and mastering. Working with producer Maryam Qudos (Spacemoth), the all-female environment allowed Cleveland to feel safe tapping into difficult places and expressing hard emotions women are socialized to suppress. Unashamedly vulnerable, unabashedly feminine, and undeniably triumphant, News of the Universe is another knockout record from a band so reliably great that it has perhaps led people to overlook how pioneering La Luz really are: women of color in indie music forging their own path by following their own artistic star into galaxies beyond current musical trends, always led by an earnest belief in the cosmic power of love and a great riff. Never is that more true than on News of the Universe, which might be La Luz's most brutal record to date but also their most blissful.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,25.2346,32.2346,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/42/4444242-3419431.jpg,FALSE,lb,19.2346,TRUE,TRUE,draft

wilder-maker-the-streets-like-beds-still-warm-explicit-lyrics-20250919,843563186763,Wilder Maker - The Streets Like Beds Still Warm LP (Explicit Lyrics),"<p>This is a preorder for 09/19/2025! We will ship as soon as your full order arrives, which will usually be that day or the following day. Occasionally, it may be up to a week later. See the full list of the week for more details, and email info@latchkeyrecords.com with any questions!</p><p>Brooklyn band Wilder Maker's principal songwriter, Gabriel Birnbaum says that the group's latest full-length, The Streets Like Beds Still Warm follows ""an overall formal asymmetry, like dream logic."" It is richly textured, moody, and deep and is as distinctly narrative as it is literally experimental. To call it a concept album, as big as that term is, would actually be to sell it short. It is, in fact, only the first part of a concept trilogy that tells the tale of one long night in the city, from dusk to dawn. The Streets Like Beds Still Warm follows a lonely narrator as he drifts down avenues and in and out of bars and hospital rooms. He thinks on big questions and bigger questions, gets into some trouble, worries about his sick father, grapples with rivals and competitors who could be his friends but are not; he orders cocktails, dreams he is a genius, thinks about God and fate and so on. The record closes out at around 1:15am, leaving the story to be continued. If this sounds a bit noirish, that's because it is. ""Film noir detectives always start out looking immaculate, but by the end of the film they have a torn collar, a black eye, their slacks are stained, and they've started slapping people around in desperation,"" Birnbaum says. ""Are they the good guy anymore? I find this fascinating and I love the visual cues reflecting the internal landscape."" While there are no visual cues, per se, on The Streets Like Beds Still Warm, the record owes a great debut to cinematography. Impressionistic swirls of effected guitar, drums, and saxophone support Birnbaum's husky and worldweary baritone croon which sometimes echoes Bill Fay. But at times, in all it's dim-lit barroom storytelling, one may think of Tom Waits. It's a comparison that threatens both to mislead and sell short, but it's difficult not to see things while listening to The Streets Like Beds Still Warm - perhaps a slowly swinging Tiffany lamp just above the narrator's head as he's a little more than half-drunk, scrawling a brilliantly poetic, antiheroic tale on a bar napkin. Be assured, though, this is not The Heart of Saturday Night and it's not In the Wee Small Hours. In fact, The Streets Like Beds Still Warm's musical precedents come from distinctly different corners of the musical universe. The band draws direct influence from the work of alt-jazz contemporaries Anna Butterss and Jeff Parker as well as ambient progenitor Brian Eno. One also hears echoes of Birnbaum's series of mellow and dreamy Nightwater records, quasi-ambient four-track experiments. But while those beautiful recordings were solitary affairs, The Streets Like Beds Still Warm is certainly not. The record builds on Birnbaum and band's years of experience as improvising musicians, often well outside of the sort of ""indie rock"" scene with which Wilder Maker may be associated. It is, as Birnbaum puts it, ""the inverse of the typical songwriter record."" Ambling, rambling, and dreamy, these songs were culled from open-ended sessions. Wilder Maker has boasted an intact lineup for over a decade consisting of Adam Brisbin, Nick Jost, Sean Mullins, and Birnbaum, as well as perennial collaborator Katie Von Schleicher. This record showcases their interplay and musical conversation in a way that the more straightforward style of 2022's Male Models did not. To create The Streets Like Beds Still Warm, the group edited longer improvisations into more condensed pieces and then wrote over those pieces, ""turning them into songs."" Joseph Shabason, Macie Stewart, Chuck Johnson, Will Shore, Rebecca el-Saleh (Kitba), and Cole Kamen-Green all appear as well, each contributing to Wilder Maker's sound world for the first time. These stellar players' additions weave in and out of the greater conversation, drifting like crucial supporting characters, expanding and varying the record's perspective and enriching the palette of the improvisatory source material.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,25.2346,32.2346,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/17/4444317-3419501.jpg,FALSE,lb,19.2346,TRUE,TRUE,draft

A soul jazz treasure from the LA scene of the early 80s - a fantastic record that I rank with the best Strata East sides of the time! The group's led by alto saxophonist Dadisi Komolafe, and features vibes by Ricky Kelly, piano by Eric Tillman, bass by Roberto Miranda, and drums by Sunship Theus - all working together in a style that's infused with soulful, post-Coltrane exploratory energy, never going too far outside, and always staying true to the rhythmic pulse at it's core.

In fact she had been depending on monthly dialysis to stay alive for years. She lived through and for the music and you can hear it on her only solo album ""Desert Fairy Princess"" which was first issued in 1981. The mostly acoustic instrumentation brings a very natural and therefore rather retrospective sound considering the year the album was recorded. Adele and her band pull it off right from the start as if it had been 1966 and it was time for a revolution to shake the dust from the old time jazz. In a perfect way she mixes classic American vocal jazz elements with playful and more free passages, Latin music and tribal African sounds in the lengthy and quite rhythm oriented ""Man From Tanganyika"" and makes the title track start with a mystical ""Allahu akbar"" chant while it turns more and more into a dark and gloomy song with something like a psychedelic edge reminiscent of Pharoah Sanders on his early works. Wild rhythms from drums, percussions with tons of bells and chimes weave a thick groove carpet and conjure a magical atmosphere. Those jazz aficionados who love the mid 60s John Coltrane, his sidekick Pharoah Sanders and Alice Coltrane will go crazy for this album.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,35.2446,42.2446,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/82/3651782-3438135.jpg,FALSE,lb,29.2446,TRUE,TRUE,draft

Tjader - a non-Latino musician deeply immersed in Afro-Cuban and Latin jazz traditions - gathered a vibrant ensemble of percussionists and jazz soloists, capturing the spirited rhythms of mambo, cha-cha, and Afro-Caribbean styles. This 180-gram virgin vinyl reissue restores the full original album and adds four essential bonus tracks recorded between 1956 and 1959, showcasing collaborations with Vince Guaraldi, Mongo Santamaria, Paul Horn, and others.

See the full list of the week for more details, and email info@latchkeyrecords.com with any questions!</p><p>John Calvin Abney rises again from the Oklahoman prairies with his latest album Transparent Towns. The ten songs focus on how we remember, and ultimately accept, though he is not always certain the memories we carry adequately mark the moments that make us.""This record is wrapped around the passage of time, whether or not we can trust the memories that we swear on, how we forgive ourselves and others as seasons turn, and how we define what is important as we roll the boulder back up the hill,"" Abney says of Transparent Towns. ""We build these routines and live our stories, we rely on our histories and our memories - spoken and recorded. Now, we're relying on copies of copies, memories of memories, all packed like sardines into our phones, and we're losing the ability to tell our own stories. I have to constantly remind myself, as well as redefine what matters at the end of a day.""Transparent Towns is the seventh studio album for Abney, and his first since 2022's Tourist, which he crafted after spending the pandemic as an itinerant writer. In contrast Abney penned most of the album's 10 tracks during a period of introspection and convalescence while recovering from vocal cord surgery in 2023. The time to himself - ""I didn't sing for nearly a year, and after surgery, I couldn't talk for a month, and couldn't sing for over three months,"" he says, left him contemplating how to trace his experiences in the silence.The album's title track is Abney's take on the inaccessible past, witnessing loss and grief through the years, damning the ""days we let go left unsaid"", and accepting the uncontrollable circumstances we are sometimes placed in. ""The troubles and the joys exist vibrantly in your memory, but you're wondering if you remember correctly,"" Abney remarks. ""I've sometimes had this sort of confusion between memory and dreams - you crafted this ideal in your head of how things were or might be, in order to soften the blow of a harsher reality.""The places we inhabit dictate how our memories form, and for Abney, there is one place to which he is constantly drawn: Oklahoma. Although he was born in the biggest little city in America, Reno, Nevada, he grew up learning guitar and piano in Tulsa, playing bars and DIY spaces from Norman to Stillwater. His affinity for the land that raised him is evident in the production of Transparent Towns.Abney self-produced the record, tracking most of it at Cardinal Song outside of Oklahoma City, with Michael Trepagnier handling mixing and engineering. The band was comprised mostly of Sooner State musicians too, along with Lydia Loveless and John Moreland contributing harmony vocals. His signature vulnerable voice and lyrical handiwork comes through in each of the songs, along with his penchant for alternative pop melodies set against colorful chords and subtle soundscapes.Having toured for years backing up artists like Moreland, Wild Child, Ben Kweller, and S.G. Goodman, Abney embraces a lead role again, as he presses forward with the loving lament and defiant joy throughout Transparent Towns, calling us to leave behind the pressures we place on our ourselves and recognize that just because there is an ending, it doesn't mean it's the end.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,25.2346,32.2346,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/14/4444314-3419462.jpg,FALSE,lb,19.2346,TRUE,TRUE,draft

See the full list of the week for more details, and email info@latchkeyrecords.com with any questions!</p><p>Novembers Doom return with their twelfth full-length album, which is entitled ""Major Arcana"". Following six long years after their acclaimed latest opus ""Nephilim Grove"" (2019), the American dark metal stalwarts have raised the stakes even higher by creating a conceptual album that thematically draws inspiration from tarot and divination. This overarching theme reflects in the artwork and design of ""Major Arcana"" as well as in the lyrical storytelling throughout the album. Founded in 1989 in Chicago, Illinois by vocalist Paul Kuhr, Novembers Doom have continued to grow and evolve over more than three decades. Initially emerging as one of the leaders of American death doom, their debut album ""Amid It's Hallowed Mirth"" in early 1995 set the band firmly on a dark musical course. Over the following years, they have gradually refined and developed a style that they have coined ""dark metal"". Novembers Doom's mastery of seamlessly blending their death metal and doom roots with progressive, folk, and classic rock influences has allowed the band to grow and change in fresh and surprising ways, while always retaining their signature feel and atmospheres that have remained a constant throughout the band's career. From the hauntingly ethereal vibes of the opening track, 'June', through brutally crushing songs like 'Ravenous', as well as the epic sadness and yearning of tracks like 'Mercy' and 'Bleed Static' to the frenetically energetic hooks found on 'The Fool' and 'Dusking Day', their twelfth opus witnesses Novembers Doom covering a wide range of sounds and emotions.

What's the point of living if we're not trying to understand all the horror and humor that surrounds everything? These are a few of the questions lurking under the bleachers of Wednesday's new album Bleeds, an intoxicating collection of narrative-heavy Southern rock that-like many of the most arresting passages from the North Carolina band's highlight reel so far-thoughtfully explores the vivid link between curiosity and confession. Bleeds is not only the best Wednesday record-it's also the most Wednesday record, a patchwork-style triumph of literary allusions and outlaw grit, of place-based poetry and hair-raising noise. Karly Hartzman-founder, frontwoman, and primary lyricist-credits Wednesday's tightened grasp on their own identity to time spent collaborating on previous albums, plus a tour schedule that's been both rewarding and relentless. ""Bleeds is the spiritual successor to Rat Saw God, and I think the quintessential 'Wednesday Creek Rock' album,"" Hartzman said, articulating satisfaction with the ways her band has sharpened it's trademark sound, how they've refined the formula that makes them one of the most interesting rock bands of their generation. ""This is what Wednesday songs are supposed to sound like,"" she said. ""We've devoted a lot of our lives to figuring this out-and I feel like we did."" Just like Rat Saw God, one of the defining rock & roll records of the 2020s so far, Bleeds came together at Drop of Sun in Asheville and was produced by Alex Farrar, who's been recording the band since Twin Plagues. Hartzman again brought demos to the studio, where she and her bandmates-Xandy Chelmis (lap steel, pedal steel), Alan Miller (drums), Ethan Baechtold (bass, piano), and Jake ""M.J."" Lenderman (guitar)-worked as a team to bulk-up the compositions with the exact right amounts of country truth-telling, indie-pop hooks, and noisy sludge. More than ever, the precise proportions were steered by the lyricism-not only it's tone or subject matter, but also the actual sound of the words, as well as Hartzman's masterfully subjective approach to detail selection. Every image or scene is filtered through Hartzman's agile, writerly brain. The particulars deemed essential all contain revelations about Hartzman's specific obsessions and vulnerabilities, about the fragmented way she processes the world. Maybe sometimes the best way to locate truth or pain or dignity within your own life story, Bleeds suggests, is by crawling into someone else's.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,25.2346,32.2346,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/65/4437665-3419066.jpg,FALSE,lb,19.2346,TRUE,TRUE,draft

The track was born in James Curd's Adelaide studio while Fred P was in Australia, capturing a rare and organic creative moment between two respected figures in house music. James Curd, known for his work with Greenskeepers and his extensive catalog across labels like Classic, Defected, and DFA, brings a playful yet precise groove, while Fred P, the introspective deep house pioneer behind Black Jazz Consortium, adds soulful depth and hypnotic finesse. The remix package elevates things even further. Harvey Sutherland, a staple in Australia's modern funk and electronic scene, brings his analog synth wizardry (his remix credentials include Disclosure and Jamiroquai). Austin Ato, a UK house innovator with a DFTD remix for Groove Armada, injects vibrant dancefloor energy. And Junior Sanchez, a long-time figure in New York's club culture, rounds it out with a heavyweight version - he's flipped everyone from A-Trak to Madonna. This is a lineup that speaks volumes before you even hit play.Tracklisting:A1. Harvey Sutherland RemixA2. Austin Ato RemixB1. OriginalB2.

One night during the tour at Cafe Oto in London, something clicked. Our live sets started gravitating towards rhythm and hooks.It was clear that the trio - myself, Jim and Jeff - were onto something. And then we met Tara. She and I played together at an improvised music night and, for about 45 seconds during one of the pieces, a new path became clear. So Tara joined the band.The new line-up felt alive and direct. So an approach to songwriting that had become abstract snapped into focus. I think these are the best songs I've written and the best group I've been in. The music and ideas we've always wanted to communicate are alive but we've shifted; moved into a parallel universe.

They began by writing catchy, hummable melodies about girls, parents, and food, among other things. Despite their unabashedly juvenile lyrical approach, they played with a blistering intensity rivaling any of the bands in the burgeoning hardcore crowd that they fell in with. This winning formula has carried the group for decades, as their influence has inspired countless followers (some becoming far more famous) in their wake. Now, 43 years later, Descendents are reclaiming and reissuing the album that started it all.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,29.8546,36.854600000000005,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/00/4444300-3419489.jpg,FALSE,lb,23.8546,TRUE,TRUE,draft

This is central to X, wheel, Heith's debut album and first release on PAN. It's a deep dive into his creative and spiritual practice, one where art and life are inextricable. The Liars Tell..., on the other hand, feels like a kind of respite, a moment of meditation and pause from the fatigue of dimension-hopping. As if the traveller dismounted their carriage and, standing puzzled on a crossroad, listened to the echoes of distant places. Occupying a liminal space and letting thousand of contradictory tales form the lyrics to one unfathomable song.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,56.034600000000005,64.98,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/75/4378775-3398311.jpg,FALSE,lb,50.034600000000005,TRUE,TRUE,draft

If you wait a while, the void fills in with pinpricks of light and, if you're attentive or just plain lucky-you're rewarded with the sight of the elusive meteor. That experience works as a tidy metaphor for the creative process that formed Shooting Star, the newest record from Philadelphia's Golden Apples, a prolific group of musicians formed and heralded by singer and songwriter Russell Edling.Following the ""rich jangle and big, well-developed songs"" (Bandcamp) of 2023's Bananasugarfire, Edling sought to deconstruct his creative process by centering collaboration instead of a more solitary pursuit in songwriting, even as personal matters made isolation a more natural instinct. He describes taking time to make notes of the ways, timing and forms in which songs came to him in the process of demoing the record, and regularly questioning if his approach was like that of ""watching a pot of water boil"" or waiting for a bolt of light to appear in the sky. In many ways, Shooting Star is an appeal to the muse, a record of ""songs about writing songs"" born from Edling's desire to trust his instincts despite the posturings of inner demons and creative roadblocks, and to celebrate the little wins along the way. The result is a sprawling new work packed to the brim with playful eccentricities and dynamism, one that owes as much of it's inspiration to mid-century folkies like Michael Hurley and Karen Dalton as it does to alt rock of the nineties like Yo La Tengo and Stereolab. Shooting Star is a constellation of influences, experiences, reckonings-with the state of the world, with others, with creativity, with oneself-with no two songs created in the same way. Instead of holing up in a recording studio, the creation of the record was formed by a patchwork of collaborations in a variety of recording locales, all which were later alchemized by mix engineer Matthew SchimelfenigAnxiety and isolation go hand in hand with connection and elation on Shooting Star, each sentiment harmonized by dreamy mellotron and static haze or raucous spurs of scrubby guitars and doubled vocals. Across the record's twelve songs, Edling wrestles with the human experience with an almost holistic touch, with lyrics that feel both deeply considered and sometimes wonderfully offhand. On ""Mind"" the persistent, outwardly sunny ode to chugging through life as the world burns à la The Kooks, Edling wrestles with the emotional dissonance of Western life in a time of global upheaval, singing ""if this love is an event in my mind, and all this evil is an event in my mind, I must be out of mind."" The record further unfurls with the muscular, shimmery ""Noonday Demon,"" a track that gets it's title from a book s</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,23.6946,30.6946,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/01/4444301-3419466.jpg,FALSE,lb,17.6946,TRUE,TRUE,draft

Radiate: insistent 'tin cup' tapping percussion offsets the thumping resonant beat, while two 'voices' duet - or duel?- a vocoder-processed robot vs sung, breathy, high vocal chords. A simple but heavy two-note main theme gives an ominous, almost threatening vibe, upping the tension and spicing the feel of the track. New Day: high energy, fast rattling percussion split by spacey hoover sounds introduce a robotic vocal speaking, announcing, the lyrics - 'this is a new life..., a new day' - giving a portentous significance and atmosphere. The sweetly high melodic sustained synths chords add a layer of emotion, nostalgia touched with melancholy. Compelling, involving, as well as full on techno beats.Tracklisting:A1. RadiateB1.

Morris's latest record for Karma Chief strips away the veneers of layered production and slick sounds to create an album that may be Kendra at her most authentic, one in which the creative process is vibrant, beautiful, and messy, buoyed by heart and the imperfectly perfect now. A concept album in reverse, Next ties Kendra's cast of characters (including her band: guitarist Supremo ""Premo"" Massiv, bassist Monti Miramonti, and drummer Chauncey Yearwood) to a vintage board game in the spirit of Milton Bradley's finest retro dice-rolling moments. Travel along Next's block-to-block journey, and this universe reveals itself as a mosaic of corals, creams, and pale lilac tiles. You can hear the sonic palette resonate with Morris's influences and inspirations. Decades of New York sounds and voices bend and blend at the seams of these tracks-a world where the Brill Building and Warhol's Factory thrive on the same block while Blondie and the Frightnrs explore rocksteady sounds. Doo-wop and boom-bap soundtrack a UHF network's worth of cut-and-paste stylings, all the while paced by Morris, an artist equally at home behind the lens as she is in front of a microphone. Next is an album of firsts. The album's extended gestation provided Morris with an opportunity to explore her ideas and demos. ""I've been living in this record for over a year,"" says Morris. ""I've always been a writer, and [Next] was a chance to write a record from scratch on my own."" The New York (by way of Loveland, Ohio) production is co-helmed by Kendra Morris and Leroi Conroy. It's production trades the steel and chrome sleekness for a more personal and scaled-down sound, exposing the songcraft. While earlier albums were awash in IMAX-level cinematic sweep, Next explores Kendra's perspective with a handheld 8mm kinetic energy, all the while showcasing the dynamic, soulful range of her powerhouse voice - equal parts Roberta Flack, Betty Wright, and Minnie Riperton. With recording done at Portage Studios in Loveland and additional vocals recorded at Kendra's Brooklyn apartment, the symmetry is as poignant as it is reflected in the home cooking vibe throughout. ""I wrote and recorded my demos right here at this desk with my guitar, drum loops, and my Casio keyboard,"" Morris reflects. ""To then have Leroi come here, stay a few doors down, and record the vocals felt right and right now and I'm also playing guitar [on Next] which I'm excited about, too."" Much like the best board games, you may end your journey where you began it, but the path you take along the way is where moments are made. Additional guests on the album include Ray Jacildo of Jr. Thomas and the Volcanos, lending his organ and piano to lo-fi reggae banger ""Flat Tire."" It's a track that traces the throughline from Kingstown to Bushwick and back again all with Morris' signature AM radio-ready vocals. Kendra Morris and Karma Chief Records invite you to play along with Next, a sonic journey where the roll of the dice means excitement and adventure. Explore the world, tile by tile, meet new friends like Jerry & Roger, help the gang with a ""Flat Tire,"" or read a letter to ""Dear Buddy."" Maybe you can avoid crossing paths with ""Bill.""

'THE END OF THE BRIM' aims for universally accessible listening, and by moving away from the abstract elements of his previous album, 'STEALTH,' he focuses on songs with concrete strength, supple rhythms, melodic development, and sophisticated harmonies.Takao envisioned a world in which each track stands alone with it's own unique strength, and enlisted DJ eminemsaiko as his supervisor to realize this unprecedented endeavor. Through repeated trial and error, the album was meticulously sculpted with vocalists including Yumea Horiike (Music Room), Christelle Belle (Fall), and Atsuo Fujimoto (Main Theme) of Colored Music, along with Motoi Kawabe of Mitsume and Hiroshi Haraguchi, an engineer known for his work with Haruomi Hosono and Moonriders. While this album is technically a 'solo' album, expressing the musician's personal life, it's style is not direct; instead, Takao's unique intention is embedded in it, paying homage to the commercial, professional musicians who undertake commissioned works. Therefore, he attempted to describe his musical ideals through the concept of a professional musician = objective performer, and created a multi-layered work that could be described as 'program music that expresses himself as the client and that client himself.'The cover art for this work was by Toru Otani, and the design was by Kei Sakawaki. His vision for the future has been sublimated into a unique, timeless work that shows the potential of pop music. Yuji Shibasaki's commentary, which deciphers this mysterious, non-absolutely musical album, is also a must-read!Song List1. Long2. Mar3. Music Room (Voc. Horiike Yumea)4. ARP5. SPE6. Images7.

Drawing on a host of peculiarly British musical influences, from doomy hard rock to pastoral prog and psych to the Hammer Horror theatrics of the NWOBHM, the band have swiftly risen to the forefront of the UK metal scene. Lyrically celebrating the folklore, myths and legends of Britain, they conjure the wild and witchy spirit of their forebears for a new generation. Signed to Nuclear Blast, Green Lung have released three critically acclaimed albums, Woodland Rites (2019), Black Harvest (2021) and This Heathen Land (2023). They have toured internationally with CLUTCH and performed on festival stages from Roadburn to Download.

Glo-Worm are at the heart of the '90s East Coast independent pop music scene that brought us Slumberland Records, Velocity Girl, Versus and chickfactor magazine. Glimmer [KLP054] brings all the various glo-worm 45s together under one roof. It's a real charmer, and now available for the first time as a long playing (LP) phonograph recordglo-worm formed in Washington D.C., summer 1993 and features the voice of Pam Berry (co-founder of chickfactor magazine) accompanied by Dan Searing (drums, percussion) and Terry Banks (guitar). Previously, Pam had sung in Black Tambourine. Terry played in Tree Fort Angst and a stint in English underground combo St. Christopher. Dan had been in Whorl.During the course of glo-worm's two-and-a-half-ish year lifespan, the band released three 7"" EPs (issued by the Somersault, Slumberland and K labels) and had songs on a couple of compilations, all leading up to the glimmer [KLP054] album, which compiled the 7"" EPs and added a cover of The Cure's 'Friday I'm in Love' and was released by K in 1996 as a compact disc.Pam Berry, the voice of Black Tambourine, shares songs of a more intimate and personal nature in Glo-Worm than in any of her other many combos. This results in a very satisfying listening experience as one is transported through Pamland celebrating love, loss and bohemian life in general.The members of Glo-Worm are people involved in the very beginnings of the '90s East Coast underground pop scene that gave birth to Slumberland Records (all the members of Glo-Worm have played in multiple groups on the label).During the course of Glo-Worm's two-and-a-half-ish year lifespan Glo-Worm played shows with the likes of the Magnetic Fields, Small Factory, Heavenly, The Clientele, Honeybunch, Would-Be-Goods, Pizzicato Five, Tsunami, Boyracer, Air Miami, The Legendary Jim Ruiz Group, and Ivy. The band's biggest show was in Spring 1995, opening for Radiohead at the now-razed Washington Convention Center.Besides Glo-Worm's breathtakingly beautiful original songs, Glimmer has four fun covers done in their own inimitable style: Petula Clark ""Downtown,"" Bobby Darin ""Beyond The Sea,"" Velocity Girl ""Crazy Town,"" The Cure ""Friday I'm in Love.""released by K in 1996.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,25.2346,32.2346,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/93/4444293-3420233.jpg,FALSE,lb,19.2346,TRUE,TRUE,draft

They began by writing catchy, hummable melodies about girls, parents, and food, among other things. Despite their unabashedly juvenile lyrical approach, they played with a blistering intensity rivaling any of the bands in the burgeoning hardcore crowd that they fell in with. This winning formula has carried the group for decades, as their influence has inspired countless followers (some becoming far more famous) in their wake.

The electricity of the city combined with her love of the heartland's soul music and inspired her to start her band, 79. 5. Bronco Boo (Mark Everett) began life in a Washington, D. C. hospital and was brought home to live on the wild prairies of the Northern Virginia suburbs. He changed his name to the letter ""E"" and formed the band EELS before deciding to go back to Bronco in 2025. While listening to KCRW late one night in his adoptive home of Los Angeles, Bronco heard a song by 79. 5. This led to a musical dialogue of ideas and songs sent back and forth between Brooklyn and LA. Feeling like they were onto something special, and realizing they were born with the same last name, Boo Boos decided it would be silly not to record these songs. The result is their debut album, Young Love.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,27.5446,34.5446,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/21/4437821-3408763.jpg,FALSE,lb,21.5446,TRUE,TRUE,draft

See the full list of the week for more details, and email info@latchkeyrecords.com with any questions!</p><p>NEW WORLD DEPRESSION raise the furious spirits of earth and sea on their seventh full-length ""Abysmal Void"". The album's ten songs each represent a chapter filled with one or more of humanity's failures such as delusion, greed, destruction, and war. The German death metal veterans deliver an honest reckoning with the current state of the world - brutal, unfiltered, and unforgiving. ""Abysmal Void"" continues the dark thematic journey that began in 2020 with ""Descent"" and found it's continuation throughout the band's latest album ""Interment of Sins"" (2023). Musically, NEW WORLD DEPRESSION stay on track and true to their old school death metal roots, yet ""Abysmal Void"" received a healthy dose of more groove, more atmosphere, and more depth. Sound-smith Jörg Uken has honed the album to perfection at his famous Soundlodge Studio in East Frisia, which enjoys an excellent reputation in death metal circles and beyond. NEW WORLD DEPRESSION were founded in the historic Münsterland, to the north of the more famous Ruhr Area and with the once powerful bishopric and medieval city of Münster at it's centre, in the year 2005. The Germans started out with a more death'n'roll sound on the debut EP ""The Last Step of Evolution"" (2005) as their first public sign of life, which was followed by the full-length ""Unseal Pandora's Curse"" (2008). During their early development, NEW WORLD DEPRESSION began to shift gradually towards old school death metal by taking inspiration from bands such as ASPHYX, BOLT THROWER, and OBITUARY. With the release of ""Decent"" in 2020, the Germans finally opted for a professional production and label. NEW WORLD DEPRESSION take humanity to the edge of the abyss with all the musical expertise gained from many years of experience both live and in studio. Just remember, if you listen hard to the brutal death metal inferno of ""Abysmal Void"", the abyss might also become aware of you!</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,29.8546,36.854600000000005,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/50/4444250-3419544.jpg,FALSE,lb,23.8546,TRUE,TRUE,draft

See the full list of the week for more details, and email info@latchkeyrecords.com with any questions!</p><p>Naarm/Melbourne trio Acopia return with Blush Response, their highly anticipated third album, and first release on Scenic Route. Arriving September 12, this 8-track LP captures the band at their most open and self-assured-an emotionally resonant work shaped by silence, space, and sincerity. At it's core, Blush Response is an exploration of emotional distance, unresolved feelings, and the quiet tension between vulnerability and strength. It's introspective and melancholic, yet with an underlying clarity that marks a new chapter for the group. Formed in 2018 by Kate Durman, Lachlan McGeehan, and Morgan Wright, Acopia began with a minimalist palette-slow tempos, sparse arrangements, and a distinct sense of restraint. Since then, they've evolved into a more fluid and expressive unit, blending elements of dream pop, downtempo, indie, and post-punk into a sound that's as delicate as it is disarming. Following the release of 2022's Chances and their self-titled 2023 album, Acopia gained significant critical momentum with praise from Pitchfork, The Guardian, The FADER, and The Beat. Pitchfork described their work as ""a nod to 1980s ennui and 2020s anxiety""-an apt summation of their unique place in today's musical landscape. Their growing international footprint includes support slots for Bar Italia and Tirzah, festival appearances at Golden Plains, Rising, and NTS Naarm, and a sold-out 2024 headline show at London's Lexington. Recent collaborators include UK producer Daniel Avery, who's shown strong support for the band-elevating their profile across both electronic and alternative audiences. With Blush Response, Acopia deliver their most expansive and expressive project to date- anchored by the emotional depth fans have come to expect, but now sharpened by bold songwriting and a broader sonic reach. Their arrival on Scenic Route marks an exciting new era, one that's already resonating with tastemakers, record buyers, and a fast-growing global fanbase. Following on from their debut UK/EU tour with sell out shows in London, Amsterdam & Paris - the band return to tour UK/EU again this September, followed by an Australia tour this November & their debut North American run in Q1 2026.

See the full list of the week for more details, and email info@latchkeyrecords.com with any questions!</p><p>This is a reissue of a now out-of-print album from live trio date by the legendary LA-based pianist, composer and multi-bandleader, Horace Tapscott. Pianist Horace Tapscott is always at his best when he is leading a trio. 'Sketches of Drunken Mary' features some sparkling piano revolving around a most lyrical bass part that is absolutely touching. The piece ends with a long, monstrous drum solo has to be heard to be believed. I recall hearing/seeing the mighty Sonship with John McLaughlin's One Truth band live at Central Park way back in 1979 and being knocked out by his drumming. 'Raisha's New Hip Dance' is a lovely piece that starts with some amazingly powerful and somewhat dark solo piano, with some strong two handed playing going in different directions and then winding down to somber conclusion, then building back up once again. The final piece is called 'Dark Tree' which is a great work that features a colossal, McCoy-like repeating line that is most hypnotic. The trio explodes in waves together, an immensely propulsive circular current at the center of the storm. Roberto Miranda takes an astonishing, fleet-fingered contrabass solo and then Sonship again provides a cosmic gong, cymbals and drum solo. This is a momentous offering from start to finish. It doesn't get any better than this.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,57.574600000000004,66.98,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/71/3747471-3438139.jpg,FALSE,lb,51.574600000000004,TRUE,TRUE,draft

Teaming with a cast of musicians that includes bassist Cecil McBee, flutist James Spaulding, Roy Haynes, Lonnie Liston Smith, Richard Davis, and Sanders (listed here as 'Little Rock'), etc. Thomas' patented yodel is in fine shape here, displayed alongside his singular lyric style and scat singing trademark. The set begins with a shorter, more lyrical version of Thomas' signature tune 'The Creator Has a Master Plan,' with the lyric riding easy and smooth alongside the yodel, which bubbles up only in the refrains. It's a different story on his own 'One,' with Davis' piano leading the charge and Spaulding blowing through the center of the track, Thomas alternates scatting and his moaning, yodeling, howling, across the lyrics, through them under them and in spite of them. It's an intense ride and one that sets up the glorious 'Echoes.' This tune is Thomas at his most spiritual and uplifting, carrying the mysterious drift of his tune entwined with Spaulding's flute and a set of Pan pipes, fluttering in and out of the mix before his wail comes to the fore as a solo. The end of side one reaches into Thomas' past (he sang with everyone from Count Basie to Grant Green and Mary Lou Williams) for a highly original read of Horace Silver's classic 'Song for My Father.' Thomas imbues the tune with so much emotion, it's a wonder he can keep it under wraps. Side two is more free from in nature with 'Damn Nam,' a near rant, but one possessed with melodic vision and harmonic invention with this band. There's also the deeply moving 'Malcolm's Gone,' a co-write between Thomas and Sanders that features the latter's gorgeous blowing, hard and true in the middle of the mix, and a wildly spiritual Eastern vibe coming through in the improvisation. It's the longest track on the record, and one of the most criminally ignored in Thomas' long career. The album closes with Bell and Houston's 'Let the Rain Fall on Me.' It's a shimmering straight jazz number with a beautiful piano solo by Smith. It sends out a visionary album out on a sweet, soulful note. Ultimately, this is among Thomas' finest moments on vinyl, proving his versatility and accessibility to an audience who, for too long already, had associated him too closely with the avant-garde and free jazz.-Thom Jurek/AMG</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,47.5646,53.98,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/85/3756085-3438140.jpg,FALSE,lb,41.5646,TRUE,TRUE,draft

Created when the group felt uncertain of it's place in the music world, the album catapulted the sextet to new commercial heights and signaled a distinct change in direction that the mainstream wholeheartedly embraced. Having sold more than three million copies, the four-time Grammy-winning Minute by Minute remains a pop landmark. Perhaps the Doobie Brothers didn't invent 'yacht rock' with the warm, hook-laden 'What a Fool Believes' and other similarly minded cuts on the radio-friendly Minute by Minute - look to the Top 20 title track, relaxed 'Open Your Eyes,' and horn-accompanied 'Dependin' on You' for further evidence - but the band essentially created the template many others would follow.Sourced from the original master tapes, housed in a Stoughton gatefold jacket, and pressed at Fidelity Record Pressing, Mobile Fidelity's numbered-edition reissue presents the 1978 effort on 180g 45RPM 2LP for the first time on what is the definitive-sounding vinyl version of the Rock & Roll Hall of Famers' biggest-selling record. Produced by Ted Templeman, Minute by Minute features noncongested openness, snappy rhythms, wonderful tonal balance, exceptionally clear vocals, and the right equilibrium of fine Polish and bluesy grit. Those facets emerge with previously unrealized definition, transparency, smoothness, and solidity on this reissue.

The band's Neil Hannon most recently wrote the original songs for the Warner Bros blockbuster Wonka. Neil says: ""My musical output is, for better or worse, a representation of my personality. A good chunk of that personality revels in the rumbumptious; celebrates the silly. And I made ample use of that for the Wonka songs. I have though, like everyone, a darker, more melancholy side. And for one reason or another it has been much in evidence of late. I needed to use this album as an outlet for those feelings. To work through some stuff. Mortality; memories; relationships; political and social upheaval. Everyone should get to make an orchestral pop album once in a while. It should be available on the NHS.""

Teaming up with Philadelphia production duo Maxwell Perla & Vincent John - AKA Eraserhood Sound - he's proud to present his new album 'Jr. Thomas in the Eraserhood''Jr. Thomas in the Eraserhood' came together through the magic of collaboration, and Thomas' drive to find the perfect musicians and studiocombination to fulfil his vision. After hearing Eraserhood's work with Kendra Morris, Angelo Outlaw, and Say She She, he knew he'd found the perfect match: ""The Eraserhood sessions were fuelled by focus, hard work, and puredetermination. In the late summer of 2023, I approached Vince and Max from Eraserhood with the vision of making an album-despite not having a single song written. We booked a winter session, and I spent the next fourmonths writing.""Fast forward a few months, and Thomas flew out to Philadelphia alongside his confidant on keys, Raynier Jacildo (The Volcanos, The Black Keys) for 4-days in Eraserhood's Philly studio - formerly owned and purpose-built by Questlove. The results of working in a studio rich with history are clear when listening to 'Jr. Thomas in the Eraserhood'. An authentic, analog-focused take on soul music, it pays respect to the genre whilst joining a growing movement that seeks to bring the uplifting energy of the music to a new generation of listeners. Following in the footsteps of recent breakthroughs from the likes of Jalen Ngonda, Thee Sacred Souls and Pale Jay, the record moves between sunshine-ready, groove laden cuts like 'Can't Leave You Alone' and 'By Your Side', whilst also finding space for bluesy contemplation on tracks like 'Never Be Another' - a heartfelt tribute to and old friend of Thomas' from Minneapolis.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,31.394599999999997,38.3946,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/30/4427430-3393137.jpg,FALSE,lb,25.394599999999997,TRUE,TRUE,draft

Almost as soon as Julia Steiner and Dave Sagan met during their college orientation, they started playing music together. What came out of their dorm rooms was the 5-song RATBOY EP, uploaded to Bandcamp on April 1, 2011 to share with friends and family. Now, to mark a decade since (to the day), Ratboys have hit the studio to re-inhabit these songs and bring them back to life. New recordings of the 5 original RATBOY EP songs make up the A-side of Happy Birthday, Ratboy, with 5 new versions of rare college-era tracks and the newly-written standout, ""Go Outside"" on the B-side. Featuring mainstays from their live show over the years, including ""The Stanza"" & ""Space Blows, "" pressed to vinyl for the first time and given the full band treatment, Happy Birthday, Ratboy introduces new Ratboys fans to the band's beginnings while also raising a toast to those who've been there from the start.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,28.314600000000002,35.3146,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/37/4408737-3330980.jpg,FALSE,lb,22.314600000000002,TRUE,TRUE,draft

Seductive, restless, and deeply assured, the record unspools like a night in motion. In the afterglow of her 2024 EP on drink sum wtr, praised by Clash Magazine, The Fader, BBC Radio, and others, the Brooklyn-based, UK/Nigerian musician solidifies her sound and expands it tenfold. If EXU was a spark, SWEET TOOTH is the full burn. Not so much genre-less as ""genre-full""; the album spans a bright, lush world where club bangers meet deep ballads in a striking, fully-formed hybrid of honeyed Afro-pop and scorched R&B. Across it's eleven tracks, Halima maps the push-pull of desire, transformation, and emotional reckoning. ""Sweetness on my terms,"" she offers a mantra for reclaiming softness without surrendering strength. ""The album is about the journey to reclaim one's self amidst the chaos of life and ultimately acts as a love letter to the pleasures and pain of these human pursuits."" While SWEET TOOTH declares Halima's artistic arrival, she calls it an epilogue, a reflection on past behaviors and lessons learned. ""Am I the person that I wanted to grow into becoming? I think so. I've given myself permission to be free of those things. To be bold. To take up space.""What began as a series of sketches - written in the margins of EXU's more structured sessions - slowly revealed a larger, more thrilling story. ""I wasn't trying to construct a narrative,"" Halima explains. ""I was just writing whatever felt good."" But the connective tissue was always there: late nights, heartbreaks, full-time jobs, stolen moments - the in-between of becoming. ""These songs carry three to four years of my life,"" she says. ""And hearing them together as a whole, kind of feels like blowing the lid off.""  Halima co-produced SWEET TOOTH with a sharp range of producers, including Mikey Freedom Hart (A$AP Rocky, Dev Hynes/Blood Orange, Empress Of), whose openness created room for her to explore. ""He told me, this is your playground - do whatever you want,"" she recalls. ""So I picked up the guitar and started humming."" That melody would become the album's emotional axis, 'wasting my body', introducing notions of physicality and yearning amidst the bittersweet reality of love dissolved. From there, things crystallized. The title track followed, along with the record's central metaphor: sweetness as both offering and armor. ""Studies show people with a sweet tooth are more agreeable,"" Halima says. ""That really hit. For me, people-pleasing is rooted in guilt, shame, and an irrational fear of rejection - it's my superego, which protected me once but is not my true self. SWEET TOOTH is my way through that reckoning.""</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,25.2346,32.2346,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/85/4444285-3419465.jpg,FALSE,lb,19.2346,TRUE,TRUE,draft

Building on the momentum of their 2023 debut, this record is a deeper, more expansive work-where traditional poetry and folk melodies collide with distorted guitars, buzuq drones, and fractured electronics.Recorded between a medieval house in Byblos and La Frette Studios in Paris, and produced by Radwan Ghazi Moumneh (Jerusalem in My Heart), the album reflects on feelings of dislocation and inner unrest. Tracks like the looping, autotuned ""Tatayoum"" and the thunderous opener ""Harik"" explore obsessive states and emotional turbulence, while settings of texts by Omar Khayyam, Paul Shaoul, and Egyptian folk sources highlight the band's use of language and sound as tools for navigating unstable realities.With it's mix of intense live energy and deliberate studio craft, Sametou Sawtan is SANAM's clearest statement yet-an arresting blend of tradition and experimentation grounded in the experience of cultural and personal upheaval.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,27.5446,34.5446,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/68/4444268-3419485.jpg,FALSE,lb,21.5446,TRUE,TRUE,draft

They began recording the album in 2023 but the international tours caused delays, as did the departure of original bass player Jack Kong in early 2024. New bass player Ethan Stahl (formerly of UK band Chubby and the Gang) came on board a year ago after Kong helped the band finish the tracking process. Initial album sessions took place with Paul Maybury of Rocket Science at his A Secret Location studio, with subsequent tracks recorded with Matt Blach of the Murlocs at Gizz Studios (following The Prize's European run with King Gizzard late in 2023) and, in January of this year, with Robin Mukerjee of TV Colours.The band, which features drummer Nadine Muller sharing lead vocals with guitarist Carey Paterson together with guitarists Joseph Imfeld and Austin Haire as well as new bass player Stahl, is known for it's powerful three-guitar frontline and melodic twin lead guitar. It combines punk and classic hard rock with power pop and new wave and cites it's influences as Thin Lizzy, Cheap Trick, Pretenders, Blondie, Rolling Stones, Faces, Flamin' Groovies, Tom Petty, Dwight Twilley, Phil Seymour, The Toms, The Nerves and The Motors.As a premium live act with the tunes to back it up, The Prize have regularly found themselves playing with legendary groups like the Sunnyboys, Pavement, The Stems and Guitar Wolf in addition to their pals in King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, The Murlocs and The Chats. Band members have recently started spreading themselves out into other bands as well, with Muller and Stahl joining Josh Hardy of The Chats and The Unknowns in Loose Lips, Imfeld in The States and Haire in The Judges and his own solo venture, Ozzie Hair.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,25.2346,32.2346,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/49/4451249-3436781.jpg,FALSE,lb,19.2346,TRUE,TRUE,draft

See the full list of the week for more details, and email info@latchkeyrecords.com with any questions!</p><p>Warsaw 480km is the debut LP from Irish/Portuguese quintet pôt-pot, who infuse the propulsive grooves of krautrock with a phosphorescent psych-rock radiance, all underscored by harmonium drones, hypnotic male-female vocal harmonies, and deep layers of rough-hewn texture. Evolved primarily from demos by multi-instrumentalist and lead vocalist Mark Waldron-Hyden during a period of grief and personal upheaval, the album came to life through a series of live, full-band studio sessions that document an exceptional array of talents, unified in an embrace of raw catharsis with a sweetly sinister edge.A defining element of Warsaw 480km is it's impressive range of influences and atmospheric topographies. As Waldron-Hyden describes, ""I wrote the first batch of songs while not really living in one place, so I think they have a kind of transient feel to them - developing them with the band helped me process an era in which I was emotionally freewheeling, so they remind me equally of the beautiful experience we shared as a creative unit and the difficult times that inspired them."" Lead single, ""WRSW"", exemplifies this complexity, as it's rugged rhythmic backbone carries tremolo guitars, woozy harmonium, and a half-spoken, Lou Reed-indebted vocal line in which the verse and chorus beautifully blur together.Above all, Warsaw 480km is an album that achieves it's richness and aura from deliberate economy, as Waldron-Hyden explains, ""Ollie [Oliver Smith] and Sara [Sara Leslie] are experts at getting the most out of one pedal, a shitty amp, and a guitar they borrowed, a result of innate talent and years of experience; they use some modulation for dronier passages, but it's their playing styles and understanding of 'the vibe' that are the secret ingredients."" This kind of intuitive connection and collaboration is incredibly rare, and with these ten pieces, pôt-pot accomplish something truly rapturous as they alchemize deep pain into a luminous reverie.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,25.2346,32.2346,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/87/4444287-3419492.jpg,FALSE,lb,19.2346,TRUE,TRUE,draft

Initially gaining notoriety through his work on Alfa Mist's string of cult-classic albums, he then stepped out solo; first in collaboration with pianist Maria Chiara Argirò on their collaborative 2020 album 'Flow' then in 2022 with his debut solo long player 'Resynthesis' (which featured Laura Groves & Quinn Oulton). Jamie now returns with his sophomore solo album 'Sequent', to be released 19th September via Sekito Records imprint. It features contributions from Laura Misch, Sly5thAve, Alfa Mist, Richard Spaven and Kaya Thomas-Dyke (who also painted the album's beautiful cover art). Co-produced with Alfa Mist, and inspired by albums from the likes of Milton Nascimento and Egberto Gismonti, 'Sequent' is a constantly evolving twelve-track odyssey. Recorded live, using vintage production techniques, it captures the sound of musicians at the top of their game, locked into creating an enveloping tornado of sound. Exploring the very nature of change, the album's tracks act as momentary windows into the ever-shifting nature of the compositions. Jamie's vision for creating vast, sprawling arrangements is on full display, melding with analogue sounds and warm instrumentation, with the result being a truly enthralling, cinematic and emotive listening experience. The album is announced with first single 'Shore Embrace', Jamie joined by Laura Misch on vocal duties, glassy guitar arpeggios are joined by lament-tinged saxophone motifs, propelled by dusty drums as Laura's undulating vocals flow effortlessly overhead. Second Offering 'Thinking Of Yesterday' is an autumnal and sparse composition, as descending guitar patterns meld with Kaya Thomas-Dyke's silken tones, gradually unfurling into spectral and ethereal realms. On their collaboration, Jamie explains 'I've been part of various musical projects with Kaya over the years, it was really special for me to be able to collaborate together on a track. Kaya also painted the incredible artwork for the album, an image of hexagram 24 from the I Ching, an ancient Chinese text which translates as ""Book of Changes"". Final single 'Late One' sees Jamie connect with Texas native Sly5thAve, constructing an intricate, delicate and groove-laden offering. On their creative partnership, Jamie says: ""Late One"" was written about nighttime contemplation, and the moment when the sky begins to lighten. The foundation of the track was recorded live, on the first take. It was a highlight for me to collaborate with Sly5thAve, who I met whilst touring the USA with Alfa Mist. His approach to this is beautifully unique and involves, amongst many other aspects, detailed orchestration of individual musical moments, performed by multiple layers of woodwinds."". 'Sequent' is a beautifully understated listen, led by majestic and elevational instrumentation and perfectly captured for full and unfiltered appreciation. Throughout the LP, fusion licks meet scattered drums, dancing together across great plains of tonal shifts, as it marches forward to a pace of it's own making, showing that great things cannot be rushed. It's a powerful body of work, one that surely will place Jamie shoulder to shoulder amongst his peers, and with other giants of the scene.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,39.0946,46.0946,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/59/4443459-3417817.jpg,FALSE,lb,33.0946,TRUE,TRUE,draft

The album opens with a brief rendition of ""Hava Nagila"" on Scottish bagpipes, which had earlier been considered for use in a scene later cut from the film. In common with the controversy surrounding the film, the album was banned in Ireland after Father Brian D'Arcy highlighted how it had worked it's way through a loophole in the country's censorship laws, claiming ""Anybody who buys the record and finds it funny must have something wrong with their mentality"".

The film gives an intimate view of the maverick musician, as he navigates a return to the stage post-Covid. From his everyday observations on the bus to his candid banter with his audience. Coastal is a rare peek behind the curtain of this unguarded iconoclast. The film was shot and directed by Daryl Hannah. Coastal - The Soundtrack features 11 Neil Young songs including ""Song X"", ""Vampire Blues"" ""Expecting To Fly"", ""Throw Your Hatred Down"", ""I Am A Child"", and ""Prime of Life"".</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,29.084600000000002,36.0846,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/09/4428309-3395705.jpg,FALSE,lb,23.084600000000002,TRUE,TRUE,draft

Can empathy be autobiographical? What's the point of living if we're not trying to understand all the horror and humor that surrounds everything? These are a few of the questions lurking under the bleachers of Wednesday's new album Bleeds, an intoxicating collection of narrative-heavy Southern rock that-like many of the most arresting passages from the North Carolina band's highlight reel so far-thoughtfully explores the vivid link between curiosity and confession. Bleeds is not only the best Wednesday record-it's also the most Wednesday record, a patchwork-style triumph of literary allusions and outlaw grit, of place-based poetry and hair-raising noise. Karly Hartzman-founder, frontwoman, and primary lyricist-credits Wednesday's tightened grasp on their own identity to time spent collaborating on previous albums, plus a tour schedule that's been both rewarding and relentless. ""Bleeds is the spiritual successor to Rat Saw God, and I think the quintessential 'Wednesday Creek Rock' album,"" Hartzman said, articulating satisfaction with the ways her band has sharpened it's trademark sound, how they've refined the formula that makes them one of the most interesting rock bands of their generation. ""This is what Wednesday songs are supposed to sound like,"" she said. ""We've devoted a lot of our lives to figuring this out-and I feel like we did."" Just like Rat Saw God, one of the defining rock & roll records of the 2020s so far, Bleeds came together at Drop of Sun in Asheville and was produced by Alex Farrar, who's been recording the band since Twin Plagues. Hartzman again brought demos to the studio, where she and her bandmates-Xandy Chelmis (lap steel, pedal steel), Alan Miller (drums), Ethan Baechtold (bass, piano), and Jake ""M.J."" Lenderman (guitar)-worked as a team to bulk-up the compositions with the exact right amounts of country truth-telling, indie-pop hooks, and noisy sludge. More than ever, the precise proportions were steered by the lyricism-not only it's tone or subject matter, but also the actual sound of the words, as well as Hartzman's masterfully subjective approach to detail selection. Every image or scene is filtered through Hartzman's agile, writerly brain. The particulars deemed essential all contain revelations about Hartzman's specific obsessions and vulnerabilities, about the fragmented way she processes the world. Maybe sometimes the best way to locate truth or pain or dignity within your own life story, Bleeds suggests, is by crawling into someone else's.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,26.0046,33.004599999999996,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/67/4437667-3419068.jpg,FALSE,lb,20.0046,TRUE,TRUE,draft

You may be familiar with the hypnotic, entrancing tones of Ibarra's vocals through his work with the Latin Grammy award-winning, four-piece, Bala Desejo and the band Dônica. He has also toured with the musical titan, Milton Nascimento, performing guitar and vocals, which is quite the honour and a testament to Ibarra's craft. As a solo artist, he has performed headline solo shows in Japan, Portugal and the US, as well as recently completing a support tour with the great, Seu Jorge. 'AFIM' is comprised of eight tracks, featuring Zé's own compositions as well as cover versions of tracks by contemporaries and friends, Sophia Chablau, Tom Veloso, and Dora Morelenbaum. It combines elements of MPB, jazz, pop and progressive rock in a bold, authoritative style. The album represents the intersection between different facets of the artist, from the stripped-down, intimate, guitar singer-songwriter, to dense arrangements with sweeping strings sections. Writing this album allowed Ibarra ""to explore sides of myself that had not yet been organized in an album: a certain darkness, a more cinematic musicality, a desire for new soundscapes. The album features the single, 'Transe', a song with an instantly comforting tone reminiscent of classic Brazilian songs of the past (think Caetano Veloso). It is built on a rhythmic guitar that supports dynamic sound layers, opening space for Ibarra's intense interpretation. Cinematic atmospheres that lend an air of mystery come courtesy of string arrangements by Jaques Morelenbaum.His unique cover version of Sophia Chablau's 'Segredo' is equally compelling, taking Sophia's punky-indie original in a different direction and making it feel like his own. 'Essa Confusão', a song celebrating the intensity of love and co-written by Dora Morelenbaum, is steered into epic, 70's AOR, singer-songwriter territory with wind arrangements by Ibarra, Jorge Continentino and strings by Jaques Morelenbaum. The album is the result of the collaboration of experienced musicians and long-time partners of Ibarra. Fellow Bala Desejo and Dônica member Lucas Nunes co-produced the album. The core band featured on the record consists of Lucas Nunes on organs, Alberto Continentino on bass, Daniel Conceição and Thomas Harres on drums and percussion, Rodrigo Pacato on additional percussion, Chico Lira on Fender Rhodes and Guilherme Lírio on guitar. The overall feel of the record is archetypically quintessential without slipping into retro mode. It is a stunning album from one of the finest musicians of his generation. A true star of Brazil's blooming contemporary scene.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,31.394599999999997,38.3946,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/97/4442697-3416267.jpg,FALSE,lb,25.394599999999997,TRUE,TRUE,draft

Set directly after the events of the first film, Rick Rosenthal's sequel sets itself up as the slasher equivalent of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, making a family connection between Laurie Strode and Michael Myers while getting some good kills in at the same time. Carpenter and Howarth's score is beefier and more intense than before, using layers of electronics to drive the audience to madness.As before, Myers aka ""The Shape"" is propelled by that theme, souped up with a new and more powerful arrangement from Carpenter and Howarth. HALLOWEEN II is more overtly synth and is perhaps less focused than the original score, although that certainly means it's nastier and more schizophrenic. The score also brings back the evocative 'Laurie's Theme', incorporating into a score full of harrowing musical effect, it's synthesised howls and wails piercing your ears so that by the time 'Mr. Sandman' comes around, you'll feel just like the final girl, delirious at having survived the aural ordeal.

Teaming up with Philadelphia production duo Maxwell Perla & Vincent John - AKA Eraserhood Sound - he's proud to present his new album 'Jr. Thomas in the Eraserhood''Jr. Thomas in the Eraserhood' came together through the magic of collaboration, and Thomas' drive to find the perfect musicians and studiocombination to fulfil his vision. After hearing Eraserhood's work with Kendra Morris, Angelo Outlaw, and Say She She, he knew he'd found the perfect match: ""The Eraserhood sessions were fuelled by focus, hard work, and puredetermination. In the late summer of 2023, I approached Vince and Max from Eraserhood with the vision of making an album-despite not having a single song written. We booked a winter session, and I spent the next fourmonths writing.""Fast forward a few months, and Thomas flew out to Philadelphia alongside his confidant on keys, Raynier Jacildo (The Volcanos, The Black Keys) for 4-days in Eraserhood's Philly studio - formerly owned and purpose-built by Questlove. The results of working in a studio rich with history are clear when listening to 'Jr. Thomas in the Eraserhood'. An authentic, analog-focused take on soul music, it pays respect to the genre whilst joining a growing movement that seeks to bring the uplifting energy of the music to a new generation of listeners. Following in the footsteps of recent breakthroughs from the likes of Jalen Ngonda, Thee Sacred Souls and Pale Jay, the record moves between sunshine-ready, groove laden cuts like 'Can't Leave You Alone' and 'By Your Side', whilst also finding space for bluesy contemplation on tracks like 'Never Be Another' - a heartfelt tribute to and old friend of Thomas' from Minneapolis.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,29.8546,36.854600000000005,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/29/4427429-3393136.jpg,FALSE,lb,23.8546,TRUE,TRUE,draft

Recorded at the Compound in Long Beach, home to veteran producer Antoine Arvizu (Sublime, Ryan Bingham). The band loved recording the singles ""Shattered"" and ""Safe and Legal"" there in 2023 with Arvizu and Migs (Sublime, Slightly Stoopid, Long Beach Dub Allstars. Bad Cop Bad Cop stretched their signature hooky, melodic punk into unexpected places, like the jazzy ""Las Ventanas,"" the dub-inflected ""Note to Self,"" or ""Johnny Appleseed,"" a reimagining of the Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros classic. After tracking the instruments, the band spent 10 intense 12-hour days recording vocals with longtime collaborator John E. Carey Jr. (Old Man Markley, NOFX, Get Dead). ""The singing was the most important part for us. We really tried things out,"" Dee says, adding that Gallarza stepped up to sing third harmony for the first time. Lighten Up also benefits from Windsor, an expert guitarist who not only shreds (check out the end of ""I4NI"") but whose music theory knowledge proved invaluable. ""Alex's guitar playing is just so fantastic and has really elevated our songwriting, truly,"" Dee says. Everything about Lighten Up feels elevated and genuine. ""This was the first time we didn't give a fuck about what anyone else was doing or wanted us to do. Lighten Up was for us"" Dee says.

At first he was the lead singer for ""Animal Drive"" before progressing on to a member of the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. He has since worked with Robert Plant, David Coverdale, Michael Romeo, Jeff Scott Soto, Mike Portnoy, and Kip Winger, Khalil Turk & Friends ""Turkish Delight"" amongst many others. He has been very active these last few years and has gained a huge following not only in his own country but globally. In 2023 Jelusick released ""Follow the blind man"" to an accepting audience and everyone has been eagerly anticipating the follow up album, and here it is in all it's glory. We have here 10 new tracks of razor-sharp Hard/Heavy Rock that extend the band's brilliance to dizzy heights. 2023's ""Follow the blind man"" was hailed as one of the best rock albums of that year and was released on both CD and Vinyl. It still stands high, and a follow-up has been talked about in recent months and here it is due for release later this year. The band Jelusick have a knack of breathing fresh life into the world of rock music and this new album is no exception to the rule. From opener ""Jaws of life"" to the title track ""Apolitical Ecstasy"" there is everything for the discerning rock fan. This is a worthy follow up to ""Follow the blind man"" and an essential purchase for 2025.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,37.55459999999999,44.55459999999999,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/11/4443011-3418133.jpg,FALSE,lb,31.554599999999997,TRUE,TRUE,draft

As the frontman and mastermind for A Killer's Confession, Waylon Reavis has delved into the light and dark sides of mankind on albums like The Indi erence of Good Men and Unbroken. But it is his current Victim trilogy where he delves deeper into that concept and which truly lives up to the band's name. The new album Victim 2 (MNRK Heavy), the group's fi fth studio release, continues the story of a serial killer who wants to bring horrifi c criminals to justice. But, as he's learning, there are consequences for his misguided deeds, even if he thinks they are the right thing to do. ""I write this stu for people to understand that we all have these thoughts,"" Reavis says. ""Like the devil's advocate - you've always got that devil on your shoulder, or that impulse, that little scratch on the side of your head that says, I want to do that. I've always been intrigued with that."" Reavis found further inspiration in the 2001 horror movie Frailty, in which the ""God's Hand"" serial killer murders people that he believes to be demons and that he is doing God's will. The antagonist of the Victim trilogy follows a similar path. In Victim 1, he went after people who had committed one of the Seven Deadly Sins, particularly those preying on young, innocent victims. In this sequel, he is reveling in his murder spree too much and faces a crisis of conscience.As in his previous band Mushroomhead, Reavis dons a mask onstage. ""It's not just a gimmick. I'm showing you what's on the inside, but at the same time it's what the fans want from me,"" he explains, ""I'm putting the mask on because I'm trying to explain who the character really is."" Victim 2 kicks in bristling fashion with ""Hopeless Grey"" and ""In Case Of Emergency,"" but as the story progresses the collection of songs explores di erent musical territory. Victim 2 shows how A Killer's Confession likes to blend genres, notably on the track ""Hollow."" Throughout Victim 2, the dark inner voices plaguing the murderous vigilante emerge in pitch-shifted fashion to distinguish them from his ""normal"" self. The unexpected cover of Nirvana's ""Heart Shaped Box"" halfway through the album signals a turning point for the killer as he starts re-evaluating his humanity. The closing track wraps things up in an epic, melodic fashion.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,27.5446,34.5446,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/93/4442293-3418591.jpg,FALSE,lb,21.5446,TRUE,TRUE,draft

Sylvan-born and pastoral-powered, sap-blooded and lightning-charged, this album grew out of the damp florescent corners of the woods, each note and sound, a fractal extension of their seedling sounds. It was nurtured into being at The Twilight Research Centre, a studio facility situated on the border of Somerset and Dorset. During Covid lockdown 1.0, I spent the outdoor hours we were permitted, wandering through the centre's surroundings, in the green lanes, woodlands and corridors of the wilds with their wary and flickering inhabitants, beneath the distant eyes of the soaring buzzards and the hulking red kites. I didn't expect it, but it was in the quiet, ferociously vibrant dens of nature, that I found a deeply profound connection with the natural world. It once again made sense to feel as much a part of the woods as the trees were; I felt like a natural entity in it's habitat again, not something I'd properly felt since running wild through the gullies, dells and fells of the Midlands as a child. And I became afflicted with a powerful urge to build strange electronic sound systems that were organic, chaotic, fractal and in some way reflective of the awesome natural systems that surround us and surround the centre. I plugged in the modular, and went searching for signs of life. Adding to this, just before the lockdowns, I stumbled across a three volume nature encyclopedia in a local charity shop, called ""Outline of Nature in the British Isles"" by Sir John Hammerton. The sub-heading reads ""A Comprehensive Photo-Survey of the Varied Life of Field and Hedgerow, Moor and Mountain, River, Pond and Sea"", and it's a stunning collection of grainy photographs, beautiful illustrations and wondrously poetic writing, some of which inspired track titles and of course, the album title. I also rekindled my love of Ladybird nature books such as the ""What to Look for in Spring/Summer/Autumn/Winter"" series, ""Birds and How They Live"" and ""Butterflies, Moths and Other Insects"", rebuilding a small collection I had as a child and discovering numerous volumes new to me. Between the two literary sources, I had a rich well of imagery, writing and pastoral nostalgia to draw from; and coupled with the extended sessions of blissing out in my own heavily ecstatic awe descended on me in the sheer grandness of the wilderness, I set about enticing out of the woods an album of phosphorescent electrical music, abundant with comparatively microscopic, but persistent and wild life-forces.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,36.7846,43.7846,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/56/4244956-3436705.jpg,FALSE,lb,30.784599999999998,TRUE,TRUE,draft

They must be fought."" Demon Records presents, for the first time on 2LP vinyl, the complete full-cast soundtrack of this 'lost' classic BBC TV adventure, with linking narration by Frazer Hines. The Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) is thrown into his first rematch with the Cybermen in the year 2070. Humans have colonized the Moon, and the Cybermen have identified their base as a strategic vantage point from which to invade Earth! Can the Doctor and his companions Polly (Anneke Wills), Ben (Michael Craze) and Jamie (Frazer Hines) stop them? First broadcast in 1967, this exciting adventure was written by Kit Pedler and directed by Morris Barry, with a guest cast including Patrick Barr, Andrew Maranne, Michael Wolf and John Rolfe. Whilst only two of the four episodes are known to survive on film, thankfully all four are available as sound recordings, complete with the BBC Radiophonic Workshop's familiar Doctor Who theme music. With a superb cover illustration depicting the Cybermen on the Moon, these two translucent 'Blue Moon' discs are housed in beautifully designed inner sleeves with vintage TV guide-style listings for each episode.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,42.9523,49.9523,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/22/4439022-3412054.jpg,FALSE,lb,36.9523,TRUE,TRUE,draft

This recording is what many will consider the debut of the legendary vocalist Dee Dee Bridgewater who has since gone on to a brilliant career. Connor's put together an all-star group with Herbie Hancock and Onaje Allan Gumbs on piano and Fender Rhodes, Dr. Eddie Henderson on trumpet/flugelhorn, Carlos Garnett on tenor/soprano saxes, Gary Bartz on alto/soprano saxes, Buster Williams on bass, drummer/vocalist Bill Summers and Kenneth Nash on percussion, and effective, crucial cameos by master flautist Hubert Laws. On the song, 'Love From the Sun', Connors added Nathan Rubin on violin and Terry Adams on cello.The 'best of the best' begins with the exotic theme of Hancock's 'Revelation', doubled wordlessly and beautifully by Ms. Bridgewater over Williams bouncing ostinato bass pattern with flights of fancy from Hubert Laws on flute, and superb, luminous solos from Henderson's exotic trumpet, Garnett on soprano, and Hancock on Fender Rhodes. Garnett's 'Carlos II' is another great composition with remarkable solos. Connors' own 'Drums Around The Worlds' is influenced by African and latin rhythms with emotional vocals from Summers and a drum-only section that builds in intensity. One of the high points of the album is Dee Dee Bridgewater's awesome, glorious vocalizing on Richard Clay's lovely 'Love From The Sun', in one of the greatest performances in her career, arranged by Gumbs. Elmer Gibson's 'Kumakucha' (The Sun Has Risen) is a blazing display of uptempo musicianship by Connor's driving drums, the propulsive congas of Summers and Nash, and exciting solos from Bartz, Henderson on trumpet, and Hancock's furious piano solo. The set ends with a marvelous 'Holy Waters' composed and arranged by Garnett in a scorching performance by Bridgewater on vocals, Garnett unleashing one of the greatest solos in his storied career, followed by Gumbs' astute solo.My Highest Recommendation.

Schizo's lineup included Richard Pinhas (guitar and synth), Pierrot Roussel (bass), Patrick Gauthier (synth), Coco Roussel (drums), and Olivier Pamela (vocals). Though short-lived, the group's recordings captured a boundary-pushing sound that set the stage for Pinhas' later innovations. Their debut single, ""Schizo (And The Little Girl)"" b/w ""Paraphrenia Praecox,"" was released on the SFP record label. Both tracks showcase a grinding post-psychedelic sound-infusing overdriven guitars, relentless wah-wah and dissonant, trippy electronic soundscapes. With a cosmic energy and proto-punk grit, Schizo's music was both abrasive and hypnotic. The follow-up single, released on Pinhas' Disjuncta label, marked the end of the band's brief run. Schizo's music on ""the yellow"" single diverge sharply with the later, more intricate textures of Heldon-instead reveling in a heavy, primal energy. Their raw experimentation is a vital entry in the history of French underground rock music.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,18.3046,25.3046,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/62/4444262-3419477.jpg,FALSE,lb,12.3046,TRUE,TRUE,draft

The album's ten songs each represent a chapter filled with one or more of humanity's failures such as delusion, greed, destruction, and war. The German death metal veterans deliver an honest reckoning with the current state of the world - brutal, unfiltered, and unforgiving. ""Abysmal Void"" continues the dark thematic journey that began in 2020 with ""Descent"" and found it's continuation throughout the band's latest album ""Interment of Sins"" (2023). Musically, NEW WORLD DEPRESSION stay on track and true to their old school death metal roots, yet ""Abysmal Void"" received a healthy dose of more groove, more atmosphere, and more depth. Sound-smith Jörg Uken has honed the album to perfection at his famous Soundlodge Studio in East Frisia, which enjoys an excellent reputation in death metal circles and beyond. NEW WORLD DEPRESSION were founded in the historic Münsterland, to the north of the more famous Ruhr Area and with the once powerful bishopric and medieval city of Münster at it's centre, in the year 2005. The Germans started out with a more death'n'roll sound on the debut EP ""The Last Step of Evolution"" (2005) as their first public sign of life, which was followed by the full-length ""Unseal Pandora's Curse"" (2008). During their early development, NEW WORLD DEPRESSION began to shift gradually towards old school death metal by taking inspiration from bands such as ASPHYX, BOLT THROWER, and OBITUARY. With the release of ""Decent"" in 2020, the Germans finally opted for a professional production and label. NEW WORLD DEPRESSION take humanity to the edge of the abyss with all the musical expertise gained from many years of experience both live and in studio. Just remember, if you listen hard to the brutal death metal inferno of ""Abysmal Void"", the abyss might also become aware of you!</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,31.394599999999997,38.3946,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/51/4444251-3419545.jpg,FALSE,lb,25.394599999999997,TRUE,TRUE,draft

Following six long years after their acclaimed latest opus ""Nephilim Grove"" (2019), the American dark metal stalwarts have raised the stakes even higher by creating a conceptual album that thematically draws inspiration from tarot and divination. This overarching theme reflects in the artwork and design of ""Major Arcana"" as well as in the lyrical storytelling throughout the album. Founded in 1989 in Chicago, Illinois by vocalist Paul Kuhr, Novembers Doom have continued to grow and evolve over more than three decades. Initially emerging as one of the leaders of American death doom, their debut album ""Amid It's Hallowed Mirth"" in early 1995 set the band firmly on a dark musical course. Over the following years, they have gradually refined and developed a style that they have coined ""dark metal"". Novembers Doom's mastery of seamlessly blending their death metal and doom roots with progressive, folk, and classic rock influences has allowed the band to grow and change in fresh and surprising ways, while always retaining their signature feel and atmospheres that have remained a constant throughout the band's career. From the hauntingly ethereal vibes of the opening track, 'June', through brutally crushing songs like 'Ravenous', as well as the epic sadness and yearning of tracks like 'Mercy' and 'Bleed Static' to the frenetically energetic hooks found on 'The Fool' and 'Dusking Day', their twelfth opus witnesses Novembers Doom covering a wide range of sounds and emotions. Get ready to hear ""Major Arcana"" and to see it unleashed onto an eagerly anticipating world!</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,42.1746,49.1746,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/38/4444238-3419540.jpg,FALSE,lb,36.1746,TRUE,TRUE,draft

They are a long-standing collective of three celebrated innovators of contemporary music: alto saxophonist Steve Lehman, pianist Vijay Iyer, and drummer Tyshawn Sorey. Since their last release - Door in 2008 - all three musicians have climbed to the pinnacle of the jazz and improvised music scene, receiving universal critical acclaim and top awards such as MacArthur Fellowships and a Pulitzer Prize and have each individually helped reshape the language of creative music over the last two decades. As a group, they continue to explode the possibilities of collective improvisation. Fieldwork's music reflects the sum part of jazz, modern composition, African and South Asian music, underground hip-hop, electronica, and the influential music of Chicago's AACM, all funneled through a collective ethos. Their musical imagination is far ranging, with rigor, daring, and a unique aesthetic palette. Together they conjure a dense, visceral musical world, tightly unified and high-impact, with a mysterious inner logic. The performances on Thereupon captures their state-of-the art interplay; they listen deeply, responding to one another with a rare intensity that blurs the lines between composition and improvisation. With this new chapter, Fieldwork reaffirm their role as one of the era's most vital experimental units.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,25.2346,32.2346,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/36/4442936-3417837.jpg,FALSE,lb,19.2346,TRUE,TRUE,draft

Now, with Eldora, he doubles down.Written primarily in the quiet of Eldora, Colorado just days after Rice performed at the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheatre, the album captures the clarity and creative spark he found in that high-altitude stillness. What emerged in those mountains is a collection rooted in songwriting over spectacle - showcasing the raw, reflective spirit of an artist more connected than ever to his craft, and shaped by the kind of authenticity only time and hard-earned perspective can bring. Eldora is more than a place. It's a state of mind - and a landmark in a career now defined not by hits, but by honesty.</p>",Alliance Entertainment,Media > Music & Sound Recordings > Records & LPs,Records & LPs,"preorder club,preorder20250919",Title,Default Title,180,shopify,continue,manual,25.2346,32.2346,TRUE,TRUE,https://mediacdn.aent-m.com/prod-img/500/53/4444853-3419962.jpg,FALSE,lb,19.2346,TRUE,TRUE,draft

He became the first modern bluesman, evolving the country blues of the Mississippi Delta. Johnson was a songwriter of searing depth and a guitar player with a commanding ability that inspired every blues artist that followed in his wake. Several songs from this set were repeatedly covered throughout the blues-rock explosion of the Sixties by many artists, notably Eric Clapton, Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, The Rolling Stones, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, Led Zeppelin, The Doors, and ZZ Top, among many others.
